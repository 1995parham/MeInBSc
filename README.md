## Introduction
I was BSc Student of the Amirkabir University of Technology from 2013 until 2017.
In our university at graduation's ceremony, friends write a memo for each other. In this repository, I have collected my diaries written by my friends.
Many of my friends and colleagues have migrated to other countries due to Iran's severe conditions. So I hope they are satisfied and successful wherever they are and know that I miss them so much.

## Thanks to all of my friends
